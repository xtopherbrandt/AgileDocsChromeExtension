# AgileDocsChromeExtension
A Chrome Extension For Agile Docs / Pivotal Tracker

Agile Docs (https://pivotal-pdf.appspot.com) is a tool to create well formatted PDF documents from Pivotal Tracker user stories. This chrome extension embeds a call to Agile Docs within the Pivotal Tracker application. With the extension installed a PDF button appears in tool bar with the multiple stories selection tools (CSV, clone, delete...). Clicking PDF will generate a PDF document of the selected stories.

The Agile Docs extension controls PDF generation options. Currently the only options are document format and whether to include activities. The Full Document format includes the entire description of each story whereas the Summary Document format includes only the first paragraph of each story. Include Activity only works with the Full Document format and sets whether the activity comments will be included with the story.
